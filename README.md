# bartha (aka Digital Treasure)
A SHA256 hashing project

This is a hash generating project that aims to use my CPU's existence and access to electricity to calculate hashes of a hash of Justin Bartha (the National Treasure actor). The goal of this project is to use my CPU to generate strings with SHA256 outputs that contain as many zeroes as safely possible with my hardware.

I chose Justin Bartha because he endorsed Bernie Sanders and was the computer person in National Treasure. The former reason is why I chose the name Digital Treasure.

This cannot solve the SHA256 puzzle, the number of possible SHA256 hashes is roughly the number of oxygen atoms in the observable universe, which is huge considering that 16 grams of oxygen is "only" 6.023X10^23 atoms.
